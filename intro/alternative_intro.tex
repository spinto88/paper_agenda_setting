\par Typical works in agenda-setting theory in any of its stages are based on the comparison between the media agenda and the public agenda. 
HABLAR SOBRE METODOS TRADICIONALES ....



\par In this work we propose to employ unsupervised topic modeling to detect the most important topics and follow their dynamics over time.
Unsupervised topic modeling is a widely used technique in the analysis of a large corpus of documents.
It is an alternative to the dictionary-based analysis, which is the most popular automated analysis approach in social science research \cite{guo2016big}, and allows to work with a corpus without a prior knowledge, letting the topics emerge from the data. Despite the popularity of this methods, we believe that there is still a lack in the employment of these ones through the lens of the agenda setting framework.
\par As mentioned above, many works based on news corpus emphasize the performance of the topic model over a labeled corpus, focusing on the proper detection of the topics \cite{dai2010online}\cite{po2016topic}\cite{brun2000experiment}.
The temporal profile of topics is usually embedded in the context of topic tracking \cite{hu2016news}\cite{li2017joint}, or in the recognition of emerging topics in real-time \cite{cataldi2010emerging} mostly applied to social media.
Typically a dynamical description is not carried out in a set of topics but rather focused on a single issue.
For instance, in \cite{soroka2017negativity} it is shown that the newspapers and Twitter have an opposite reaction to the changes of the unemployment rates, in \cite{guggenheim2015dynamics} the competition of frames in this case about gun control is explored,
and in \cite{ali2018measuring} it is shown how twitter activity varies in different regions depending on the location of terrorist attacks.
A remarkable exception is \cite{russell2014dynamics} where they work with a set of predefined issues. In this work the question of \emph{causality} is also faced up. Their study shows that sometimes the traditional media set the agenda and sometimes, the social media does. They show that social media is always more interested in social issues than the traditional one, and despite the existence of correlation, the social media agenda can not be seen as a \emph{slave} of the traditional media.

% Presentación y descripción de nuestro trabajo
\par In this work we propose a simple method to the study of Mass Media and audience response through topic detection algorithms.
Our work intends to contribute another quantitative approach which complements the agenda-setting theory describe above.
Rather than focus on a single issue or a set of independent topics, we work with the agendas (the media and the public) as an object in their own, studying their evolution over time.
On the other hand, we aim to take an insight about Media dynamics and Public response in order to create useful tools at the time of constructing mathematical models about the interaction between Media and Public, investigation that we started in \cite{pinto2016setting}.
